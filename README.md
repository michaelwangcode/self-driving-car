# Self Driving Car

## About

This Javascript project uses a neural network to simulate a self driving car without any external libraries. 

The tutorial for this project can be located [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs_rAxEsAvI).


## Part 1: Car Driving Mechanics

In Part 1 of the project, the car and controls are defined. 

Using the arrow keys, a user is able to move the car forwards and backwards as well as steer the car left and right.

Speed, acceleration, max speed, friction and angle are properties of the Car class.

The Controls class listens for when the arrow keys are pressed and released.
